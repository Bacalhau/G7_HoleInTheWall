/**
*----------- VDMA CONFIGURATION  --------------
*REGISTERS TO WRITE
*1) vdma[12]: VDMA control register.
*2) vdma[43]: initial memory address to write to.
*3) vdma[42]: number of bytes per line in memory.
*4) vdma[41]: number of pixels per line in memory, defined in bytes.
*5) vdma[40]: number of lines in memory.
*
*SUGESTION OF USE
*Run programming in the same sequence as default. VDMA will be active only after vdma[40] is written.
*vdma[43] is the register that will be changed during frame sync.
